## Godot Multiplayer Setup Tutorial - Reference Project

Hello and welcome.

This repository contains reference material for two tutorials that can be found on my web page [kehomsforge.com](http://kehomsforge.com), both related to multiplayer games with Godot.

The first tutorial can be found [here](http://kehomsforge.com/tutorials/multi/gdMultiplayerSetup). It contains very basic multiplayer game setup with Godot. The result of the first tutorial is in the master branch of this repository.

The second tutorial, which is a follow up to the first, contains some advanced topics as well as some fixes to some oversights of the first tutorial. The result of it can be found on the *MoreNetworking* branch and the tutorial itself can be found [here](http://kehomsforge.com/tutorials/multi/gdMoreNetworking).
